Covid Patient Management System provides a strong database to add new covid patients into covid centers of all zipcodes and helps navigate the users to their preferable covid centre with the report of number of beds free. This cuts the delay in admitting the patients to hospitals at the right time saving their life, and hence reduces the spread rate too.
